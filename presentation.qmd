## What is TWPI? Background ..

Equity market products must be traded on a lit market (ASX trading platform).

Why? Promotes liquidity and price formation.

Exception:

- block trade
- portfolio trade
- out-of-hours trade
- Trade with price improvement (TWPI)

## What is TWPI? Technically ..

Price Improvement: 

- higher than best bid, lower than best offer
- better price than lit market -> investor's gain

TWPI occurred on the broker's internal system (dark market), for example: crossing system.

## Research Problem

<div style="font-size:32px;">
Background:

1. Rule change in 2013: TWPI must be better than lit market price ..
    - ensuring liquidity, better price formation in the lit market (investor POV)
    - ASX business model: public owned company, seeking for profit (ASX POV)
    
2. ASIC review of TWPI in 2022: 
    - TWPI reported not exactly occurred at better prices.  
</div>

Questions:

- Do ASX gaining profit after imposing TWPI?
- How many violations of TWPI rule?
